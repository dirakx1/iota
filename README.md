# Iota
Iota documentation and notes
IOTA is a distributed ledger technology that allows computers in an IOTA network to transfer immutable data and value among each other.

To send and receive IOTA tokens, clients send packages of transactions called bundles to nodes. The transactions in a bundle instruct the node to transfer IOTA tokens from one address to another. These addresses are derived from a client's unique secret password called a seed.
When the bundle is confirmed in the Tangle, the IOTA tokens are transferred.
