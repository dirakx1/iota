# IOTA Digital Assets 

(also called Colored Coins) are tokens that are based on IOTA and can be used to tamper-proof represent assets from the real world. 
Basically they remain “normal” IOTA tokens but in a certain context or in a specially created app they can mean different things and may have a higher 
value than the normal IOTA token. For a better understanding you can also imagine this as a kind of label, which is stuck to the token 
when sending it and identifies it as a special token. The regular IOTA token is only used as carrier. 
The term Colored Coin has also been established in the cryptoscene.
