# Whats an SC ? 
A Smart Contract is a programmed agreement that is fully deterministic and automatically enforced by encapsulating the contractual obligations between buyer and seller in the software. This makes it impossible to deny this agreement.

Basically, SCs were created to make the enforcement of a contract by third parties, such as a central authority, unnecessary. SCs enable the execution of trustworthy transactions which are traceable, transparent and irreversible. “Experts” are generally expected to use SCs in the future to replace many types of real paper contracts. With these new technological possibilities, many types of business processes in many industries can be executed much more efficiently and costs can be reduced.

# ISCP 
The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP) was derived from the Qubic project and preserves many of its useful features. 
The new SCs can be seen as an offset that shifts priorities towards a pragmatic solution. In essence, 
IOTA Smart Contracts are “Quorum-based Computations” and therefore do not deviate too far from the “original” Qubic vision.

### Alpha release
"The most anticipated aspect of the Alpha release is that developers can now create IOTA based smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), deploy smart contract chains run by Wasp nodes and deploy smart contracts on those chains. After finalization of the current integration of the “Mana” module into the Coordicide testnet in its current “Pollen” stage, IOTA Smart Contracts will be able to be deployed using Wasp nodes. The current integration of the Mana module into Pollen represents a major building block of the leaderless consensus algorithm of the future IOTA protocol. The ISCP team therefore decided to focus on the ability to deploy Smart Contracts on Wasp nodes until after the Mana module integration has been finalized in the coming weeks."

### Conclusion

"IOTA SCs are smart contract programs run by an approved committee on the sec"ond layer (off-tangle). The committee of nodes collectively updates the ledger by submitting signed transactions (using threshold signatures) to the Tangle.

IOTA SCs are very flexible and require much fewer resources than blockchain alternatives. They enable use cases that would not have been possible with fees as the only incentive. This is especially true in the IoT space, where micro-contracts and micro-transactions are likely to become the norm. In the first SC release, IOTA will initially use WebAssembly, but in the future this will not remain the only virtual machine (VM), so other programming languages and VMs will be usable."
