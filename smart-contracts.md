# ISCP 
The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP) was derived from the Qubic project and preserves many of its useful features. 
The new SCs can be seen as an offset that shifts priorities towards a pragmatic solution. In essence, 
IOTA Smart Contracts are “Quorum-based Computations” and therefore do not deviate too far from the “original” Qubic vision.
